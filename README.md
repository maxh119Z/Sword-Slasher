Sword-Slasher!
You start off as a sword and are stuck within a matrix surrounded by other enemy swords.

How to play
Use standard w, a, s, d keys to move around.
To kill a mob simply click and the sword will swipe, killing the mob if you do enough damage
For each mob kill you get, you earn coins and if a mob hits you you take damage
You can hit the b key to access the shop and purchase upgrades and items with your well earned coins.
After you die, you lose all your progress and can play again. Additionally there is a leaderboard, chat, and customs menu where the chat updates realtime. We used PHP.
You can pause the game at any point by opening shop, chat, leaderboards, etc.

#Have Fun!!!
